## 🚀 Project Overview

Most productivity tools are either too bloated or too simple. **DailyForge** is a no-nonsense weekly planner that gives you total control over your schedule — built by students, for students and professionals alike.

**What it does:**
- Build a reusable **task library** with custom durations, colors, and categories
- Design **weekly routines** by dragging tasks into a visual time grid
- Save, update, and delete **routines** with one click
- Automatically detects and prevents **scheduling conflicts** for the same day

**Why it matters:**  
Most people don't fail to plan — they fail to stick to a plan. DailyForge makes routines feel visual and deliberate, making habits easier to build and track.

**Key highlights:**
- ⚡ Drag-and-drop weekly planner powered by `@dnd-kit`
- 🔒 Secure JWT authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- 🗂️ Reusable routine templates to clone and reuse schedules
- 🚫 Conflict detection — no overlapping tasks on the same day
- 📱 Clean, responsive UI built with React 19 + Tailwind CSS v4

## ⚡ Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js v18+, npm v9+, a free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryandas2911/DailyForge.git
cd DailyForge
```

---

### 2. Set up the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

**Create your `.env` file from the given template** (see the [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section below):

```bash
# Inside the /backend directory

cp .env.example .env   
```

Then fill in your values (see the next section for what each variable means).
 
> ⚠️ **Local dev note:** The backend CORS origin is already configured for both the deployed frontend (`https://dailyforge-frontend-lhjq.onrender.com`) and local development (`http://localhost:5173`) in `backend/src/server.js`. No changes are needed for local development.


**Start the backend dev server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

> ✅ Server should start at `http://localhost:5000`

---

### 3. Set up the Frontend

Open a **new terminal**, then:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

> 💡 **Local dev note:** To point the frontend to your local backend, copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env` and ensure `VITE_API_URL` is set to `http://localhost:5000/api`.

**Start the frontend dev server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

> ✅ App should open at `http://localhost:5173`

---

### ✅ You're ready!

Open `http://localhost:5173`, sign up for an account, and start building your routines.

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables


### Backend — `backend/.env`

Copy the provided template to get started. **Never commit the .env to git.**

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_here
#CLIENT_ORIGIN=your_deployed_frontend_url
```

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PORT` | ✅ | Port on which the Express server runs (default: `5000`) |
| `MONGO_URI` | ✅ | Full MongoDB Atlas connection string — get it from your Atlas cluster's "Connect" menu |
| `JWT_SECRET` | ✅ | Secret key for signing JWTs — use any long, random string (e.g., `openssl rand -hex 32`) |
| `CLIENT_ORIGIN` | ⬜ | *(Optional)* Allowed CORS origin for API requests. Set this to your production frontend URL (e.g., `https://dailyforge-frontend-lhjq.onrender.com`). If not set, it defaults to `http://localhost:5173` for local development. |

**How to get `MONGO_URI`:**
1. Log into [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
2. Create a free M0 cluster (if you haven't)
3. Click **Connect** → **Connect your application** → Copy the connection string
4. Replace `<password>` with your DB user's password

### Frontend — `frontend/.env`

Copy the provided `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`. 


**Running locally?** Update `VITE_API_URL` in your local `.env` file to `http://localhost:5000/api/`.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Common Cause | Quick Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CORS Errors** | `FRONTEND_URL` mismatch in backend `.env`. | Match it to your local frontend URL exactly (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). Restart server. |
| **Database Failures** | Incorrect credentials or IP restriction. | Replace `<password>` with your database user password. Whitelist `0.0.0.0/0` in Atlas Network Access. |
| **Dependency Conflicts** | React 19 / Tailwind v4 version strictness. | Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in both directories. |
| **Glitchy Drag-and-Drop** | DOM-altering browser extensions. | Test the application in an **Incognito window**. |

## 🌐 Google Authentication Setup

DailyForge supports Google Authentication via Firebase. Follow these steps to configure and enable Google Sign-In:

### 1. Firebase Console Setup
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and click **Add project** to create a new project.
2. Once the project is created, click the **Web icon (`</>`)** on the Project Overview page to register a new Web App.
3. Copy the `firebaseConfig` object containing the API key, app ID, etc.
4. Go to **Build** → **Authentication** in the left sidebar and click **Get Started**.
5. Under the **Sign-in method** tab, click **Add new provider** and select **Google**.
6. Enable the provider, configure your support email, and click **Save**.

### 2. Environment Variables Configuration

To enable the frontend and backend integration, copy the configuration values into your respective `.env` files:

#### Frontend — `frontend/.env`
Append your Firebase client configuration to your local `.env` file:
```env
# Firebase Client configuration
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

#### Backend — `backend/.env`
Add your Firebase Project ID to secure RS256 token verification:
```env
# Firebase verification configuration
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

---

## ❓ FAQ

### Why is the app slow on first load?

The project is deployed on Render’s free tier. Services may go to sleep after inactivity, so the first request can take around 30–60 seconds to respond.

---

### Which Node.js version should I use?

Recommended versions:

* Node.js `v18+`
* npm `v9+`

Check your installed versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

---

### Do I need MongoDB installed locally?

No. DailyForge uses MongoDB Atlas, so you only need a free Atlas account and a valid connection string.

---

### Why am I getting CORS errors during local development?

Make sure:

* Backend CORS origin is set to:

```js
origin: "http://localhost:5173"
```

* Frontend `.env` contains:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

---

### Where should I add environment variables?

Backend variables go inside:

```bash
/backend/.env
```

Frontend variables go inside:

```bash
/frontend/.env
```
---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Common Cause | Quick Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CORS Errors** | `CLIENT_ORIGIN` or `FRONTEND_URL` mismatch in backend `.env`. | Ensure backend `.env` has correct origin (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). Restart the server after changes. |
| **MongoDB Connection Error** | Incorrect `MONGO_URI`, wrong credentials, or IP not whitelisted. | Verify `MONGO_URI`, replace `<password>` with correct DB password, and whitelist `0.0.0.0/0` in MongoDB Atlas Network Access. |
| **Frontend Cannot Connect to Backend** | Backend not running, wrong API URL, or port mismatch. | Set `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api` and ensure backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`. |
| **JWT Authentication Errors** | Missing or incorrect `JWT_SECRET`. | Add `JWT_SECRET` in `backend/.env` and restart the backend server. |
| **Dependency Conflicts** | React 19 / Tailwind v4 strict peer dependency issues. | Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in both frontend and backend directories. |
| **Glitchy Drag-and-Drop** | Browser extensions interfering with DOM events. | Test the app in **Incognito mode** or disable extensions. |
| **Port Already in Use** | Another process is using the same port. | Stop the running process or change `PORT` in `.env` (e.g., `PORT=5001`). |
| **Dependency Installation Issues** | Corrupted `node_modules` or lock file conflicts. | Run `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`. |
